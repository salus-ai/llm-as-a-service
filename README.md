# LLM-as-a-Service ‚òÅÔ∏èüöÄ

This repo contains code that will deploy scalable APIs for Open Source LLMs on Kubernetes.

## Set up

## Deploy in AWS

You need a Kubernetes cluster and `kubectl` set up to be able to access that cluster. On AWS, we use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) for this. 
- Please refer to the [Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) on how to set things up
- Make sure you can [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) installed and configured as well

Also, make sure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed and running in your environment

### Set up Paradigm MLOps tool

In a terminal with the above kubectl access, follow the below steps.

- (Recommended) Create a new Python environment with your preferred environment manager
- Clone this repo 
    - `git clone https://github.com/ParadigmAI/paradigm.git`
- Go into the directory 
    - `cd paradigm`
- Make the installation script executable 
    - `chmod +x install-aws.sh`
- Run the intallation script 
    - `./install-aws.sh`
- Validate if paradigm was properly installed
    - `paradigm --help`

### Run the UI

Install the dependecies in your Python environment by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

```
streamlit run app.py
```
In this UI you can choose which model to deploy. Keep track of the terminal logs to get the load balancer IP that will expose the API endpoints. 

The API docs will be avaiable at `<LOAD_BALANCER_IP>/docs`
